# Code Review and Recommendations for "flash"

This document summarizes the findings of a code review for the "flash" file transfer tool. The review focuses on identifying potential faults, areas for improvement, and recommendations for making the tool more robust, secure, and performant.

## Overall Assessment

The project is a solid first implementation of a file transfer tool using a custom reliable UDP protocol. The code is well-structured, and the use of a NACK-based mechanism for retransmissions is a good design choice. However, to be considered "ultra-fast" and reliable for real-world use, several critical features are missing.

## Key Strengths

*   **Clear Structure:** The project is well-organized into `cmd`, `pkg/packet`, and `pkg/transfer` packages, which promotes maintainability.
*   **NACK-based Reliability:** The use of Negative Acknowledgments (NACKs) is an efficient way to handle packet loss by reducing redundant feedback from the receiver.

## Critical Areas for Improvement

### 1. Lack of Congestion Control

This is the most significant issue. The client sends data at a fixed, hardcoded rate. This approach doesn't adapt to varying network conditions. On a congested network, it will lead to high packet loss, frequent retransmissions, and ironically, a much slower transfer. A truly fast system must be able to sense network capacity and adjust its sending rate accordingly.

### 2. No Security Features

*   **Encryption:** All data, including the file content, is sent in plaintext. This is a major security vulnerability, especially over public networks.
*   **Authentication:** There is no mechanism to verify the identity of the sender or receiver.

### 3. Inefficient NACKs

The current implementation sends a NACK for each individual missing packet. In cases of bursty packet loss, this can be inefficient. A better approach would be to send NACKs that specify ranges of missing packets.

### 4. Lack of Robustness

*   **Hardcoded Timeouts:** The client uses a fixed 5-minute timeout, which may not be suitable for all file sizes or network speeds.
*   **Incomplete Files:** A failed transfer will leave a partial file on the server. It's better to write to a temporary file and only move it to the final destination after a successful transfer and hash verification.

## Recommendations

To address these issues, the following actions are recommended, in order of priority:

1.  **Implement Congestion Control:** Add a token bucket algorithm to the client to control the data transmission rate. This will make the transfer much more stable and efficient.
2.  **Add Encryption:** Integrate AES encryption to secure the file data during transfer.
3.  **Improve the NACK Mechanism:** Modify the NACK packets to support ranges of sequence numbers.
4.  **Improve Robustness:**
    *   Implement dynamic timeouts that are based on network activity.
    *   Use temporary files on the server to avoid leaving partial files in case of a failed transfer.

By implementing these recommendations, "flash" can become a more performant, secure, and reliable file transfer tool.
